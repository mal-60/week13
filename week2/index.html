    <h2> So what is HTML?</h2>
    <p> HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.</p>

    <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
      wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain
      way, or act a certain way</p>
